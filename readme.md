## Ideas to fill extra time
1. Add websockets to keep all users up to date.
2. Add badges to schools and students tabs to notify users of newly created (websocket) items.
3. Add a "Create Random Student" function that uses https://randomuser.me/.
4. Search feature for longer student lists.
5. Buttons to order student by each column.
6. Standardize styles.
